# React-Todo-List
first react project, tailwind for styling

I've been learning React for almost 2 weeks now and was able to make
this Todo list with what I've learned so far. I'm really loving it so
far, some JS methods have been hard to wrap my head around but this project
has definitely helped me. Hardest part for me had to be "lifting up state" 
and will definitely be practicing that whenever I can. I used Tailwind
for styling which was very simple to setup. After this project, I feel really
close to my end goal and feel like I can finally start applying to frontend
developer jobs.
